# A Web Developer's Notes

> Primarily in relation to the MERN stack.

The objective of this repo is to simply store a collection of my own notes and experiences. This is in hope of providing a quick review for myself, both for general usage and for obscure troubleshooting.

My development environment is setup using Windows 10 and the Winbows Sybsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu. I add in notes that relate to how I troubleshooted setup problems that specifically relate to my environment.
