DOCUMENTS

    MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation
of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

    MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the following
structure:

{
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2,
    field3: value3,
    ...
    fieldN: valueN
}

    The value of a field can be any of the BSON data types, including other
documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

FIELD NAMES

    Field names are strings.
