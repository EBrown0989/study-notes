DOCUMENTS

MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation
    of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the following
    structure:

{
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2,
    field3: value3,
    ...
    fieldN: valueN
}

The value of a field can be any of the BSON data types, including other
    documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

FIELD NAMES

Field names are strings.

Documents have restrictions on field names:

- _id is reserved, and must be unique within the collection. It's immutable and
    may be of any type other than an array.
- cannot contain null
- top-level field names cannot START with $.

IMPORTANT!
The use of $ and . in field names is not recommended as it is not supported by
    the official MongoDB drivers.

Some documents created by internal MongoDB processes may have duplicate fields,
    but no MongoDB process will ever add duplicate fields to an existing user document.

Field Value Limit - Maximum Index Key Length

DOT NOTATION

MongoDB uses the dot notation to access the elements of an array and to access
    the fields of an embedded document.

"<array>.<index>"

"<embedded document>.<field>"

DOCUMENT LIMITATIONS

Document Size Limit

Document Field Order

- The _id field is always the first field in the document.
- Updates that include renaming of field names may result in the reordering of
    fields in the document.

    Since version 2.6, MongoDB actively attempts to preserve field order in a document.

The _id Field

- Acts as a primary key.

!WARNING!
To ensure functioning replication, do not store values that are of the BSON
    regular expression type in the _id field.

OTHER USES OF THE DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

- Query Filters
- Update Specifications Documents
- Index Specification Documents
