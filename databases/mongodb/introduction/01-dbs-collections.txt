DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS

MongoDB stores BSON documents, i.e. data records, in collections;
    the collections in databases.

DATABASES

In MongoDB, databases hold collections of documents.

Select a database in the mongo shell:

    use <db>

If a database doesn't exist, MongoDB creates it when you first store data in that
    database.

    use myNewDB

    db.myNewCollection1.insertOne( { x: 1 } )

The insertOne() operation creates both the database and collection referenced, if
    they do not already exist.

COLLECTIONS

MongoDB stores documents in collecitons. Collections are analogous to tables in
    relational databases.

Create a Collection

    db.myNewCollection2.insertOne({x:1})
    db.myNewCollection3.createIndex({y:1})

Both of these operations will create their respective collections if they don't
    exist already.

NOTE - Naming Restrictions: <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#restrictions-on-collection-names>

Explicit Creation

The db.createCollection() method is used to explicitly create a collection with
    various options, such as setting the maximum size or the documentation
    validation rules.

Use collMod to modify these options.

Document Validation

By default, a collection doesn't require its documents to have the same schema.
    However, you can envorce document validation rules for a collection during
    update and insert operations.

    <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/>

Modifying Document Structure

To change the structure of the documents in a collection, update the documents to
    the new structure.

Unique Identifiers

Collections are assigned an immutable UUID, which remains the same across all
    members of a replica set and shards in a sharded cluster.

To retrieve the UUID, run either the listCollections command or the
    db.getCollectionInfos() method.
