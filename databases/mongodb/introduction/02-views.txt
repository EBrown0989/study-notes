VIEWS

MongodDB supports the creation of read-only views from existing collections or
    other views, as of version 3.4.

CREATE VIEWS

To create or define a view, viewOn and pipeline options for create
    (and db.createCollection):

    db.runCommand({create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>})

    or if specifying a default collation for the view:

    db.runCommand({create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>, collation: <collation>})

A new mongo shell helper db.createView():

    db.createView(<view>, <source>, <pipeline>, <collation>)

NOTE: You must create views in the same database as the source collection.

BEHAVIOR

Read Only - Views are read-only; write operations on views will error.

The following operations can support views:

    db.collection.find()
    db.collection.findOne()
    db.collection.aggregate()
    db.collection.countDocuments()
    db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount()
    db.collection.count()
    db.collection.distinct()

Index Use and Sort Operations -

    Views use the indexes of the underlying collection.

    You cannot create, drop, or re-build indexes on the view directly nor get a
        list of indexes on the view.

    You cannot specify a $natural sort on a view.

Projection Restrictions

    find() - doesn't support $, $elemMatch, $slice, or $meta

Immutable Name

View Creation

    Views are computed on demand during read operations, and read operations are
        executed as part of the underlying aggregation pipeline.

    If the aggregation pipeline used to create the view suppresses the _id field,
        documents in the view do not have the _id field.

Sharded View

    Views are considered sharded if their underlying colection is sharded.

Views and Collation

    You can specify a default collation for a view at creation time, otherwise
        it will default to "simple" binary comparison collator. It does not
        inherit the collection's default collation.

    String comparisons use the view's default collation.

    If copying a view, you cannot change the view's collation.

    For an aggregation, the views must have the same collation.

Public View Definition

    Operations that list collections include views in their outputs.

IMPORTANT!
Avoid referring directly to sensitive fields and values in view definitions.

DROP A VIEW

    db.collection.drop()

MODIFY A VIEW

    collMod
