<! DOCTYPE html >

    The standard document type declaration. Must be the first thing in the document.

html

    Surrounds all HTML content in a document.

head

    The document head contains all metadata about the document, such as its
        title and any references to external stylesheets and scripts.

title

    The title of the document. Browsers typically display this at the top of the
        browser window and use this title when bookmarking a page.

body

    Everything not in the head should go in the body. This is the primary visible
        content of the page.

h1, h2, h3, h4

    These let you specify headings of different levels. h1 is a top-level heading,
    h2 is below that, and so on.

p

    A paragraph!

ul, ol, li

    Unordered lists are specified with ul, most often used for bulleted lists.
    Ordered lists (ol) are often numbered. Both ul and ol should include li elements
    to specify list items.

em

    Indicates emphasis. Typically rendered in italics.

strong

    Indicates additional emphasis. Typically rendered in boldface.

a

    A link. Typically rendered as underlined, blue text, unless otherwise specified.

span

    An arbitrary span of text, typically within a larger containing element like p.

div

    An arbitrary division within the document. Used for grouping and containing
    related elements.
